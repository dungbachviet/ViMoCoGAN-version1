# ViMoCoGAN-version1
ViMoCoGAN-1 (abbreviation of View-Motion-Content GAN version 1) is a improvement developed from the original idea of MoCoGAN for generating videos in variety of views.

My improvement is to generate different viewpoints with the original idea from: [Sergey Tulyakov, Ming-Yu Liu, Xiaodong Yang, Jan Kautz, MoCoGAN: Decomposing Motion and Content for Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.04993)
